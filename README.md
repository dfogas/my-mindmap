#My Mindmap

Mindmap is just some **graphical representation of knowledge in one's head**, in
this particular case, in my head.

The good way to have view of this graphical representation is to draw it.

A better way to represent knowledge would be to construct it as 3D network
resembling the structure of the brain's memory. In this way the links would be
less entangled then in 2D image.

A compromise between the two would be well-known HTML links mechanism and
that's what I tried to accomplish here.
